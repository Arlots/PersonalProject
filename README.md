# PersonalProject
This is a private project I am working on to be a mock-up of a future website idea
+++++++

This personal project will  be a way for me to explore coding in a stress-free way that let's me learn how to implement the ideas that I have into a webpage idea. The point of this will be to learn how to take an idea from my head, and turn it into something tangible while gaining experience with the coding skills that I have learned so far. Of course, learning how to do things slightly beyong my current ability is also encouraged. I will try to document what I do thoroughly to ensure proper retention and understand of the coding process.

Day 0: 4/28/2023 - Description of Project

    For the first iteration of this project, I want to get a basic layout of information and functionality applied to the idea I have in my head. As of now, the purpose, and desired functionality of this website is described below. Additions or adjustments may be made in future iterations.

       Goal: Create a sight that helps Japanese people learn and practice English through reading. In addition to this, I want to create two divisions of the website. One is free, where anyone can come and learn English for free by reading grammar explanations provided through a blog, and then using a free reading provided alongside the explanation to practice what they have learned. The second division will be additional paid exericse. Many development focus for the time being will be one creating the free sample and get the functionality working well. 


       +++Landing Page+++

       - There should be a simple landing page with a menu of some sort that allows the visitor to select a grammar point that they want to read about. 
       - After picking a topic, the visitor should be taken to a blog post about that grammar. 
       
       +++Blog Section+++
       - There should be an accesible menu that allows the visitor to return to the landing page, or jump straight to a new grammar point.
       - The blog should include an explaination of the grammar point and any other relvancies in Japanese.
       - The bottom of the blog should include a link or button that will like to another page that has a free practice reading.

       +++Reading Exericse+++
       - There should be a menu to jump to the landing page or other blog posts. 
       - The page should include a brief summary in Japanese of the main grammar point being used. 
       - There should be an embeded set of Anki flashcards that lets users practice vocabulary before reading.
       - The reading exercise should be about 100~200 words long.
       - There should be a "level select" menu, which adjusts the vocabulary of the writing, depending on which is picked.
       - There should be a playable audio recording of the exericse.
       - There should be comprehension questions .
       - Keywords should have a pop-up box when hovered over them to describe the words meaning or nuance.
