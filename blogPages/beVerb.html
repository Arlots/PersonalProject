                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>The “be” verb is an incredibly basic form of English grammar, 
                    but it is perhaps the most important because it is extremely 
                    frequent in everyday language. 
                    However, it can also be very confusing for a many people. 
                    Despite it being called the “be” verb, it actually has many forms. 
                    And in this course, you will not use the word “be” until you learn how to talk about the future in a later lesson. 
                    But don’t worry, I’ll walk you through how to use it in this lesson. 
                </p>

                <p>Before that, let me start by introducing English word order. 
                    In English, the typical word order is: 
                </p>

                <p> Subject - Verb - Object (SV0)</p>

                <p>This word order is the foundation of English, 
                    and if you mix up this order, you will create very unnatural sentences. 
                    Let me walk you through making your first grammatical sentence. 
                </p>

                <h2>Explanation 1</h2>

                <p>Let’s start with a subject. There are many subjects in English, but we’re going to start with the most personal subject, “I.” Subjects are extremely important in English. Make sure to always have a subject. We do not omit the subject very often in English like Japanese does. 
                </p>

                <p> Subject - Verb - Object (SV0)<br>&emsp; I</p>

                <p>Now, that I have my subject, I need to add in the verb and object to finish the sentence. The topic of this lesson is the “be” verb, so I know that “be” is going to be the verb I use here. However, the “be” verb changes form based on tense as well as subject. For this lesson, let’s focus on how it changes with subjects. 
                </p>

                <div class="beVerbTableContainer">
                    <div class="beVerbTableTop">
                        <div><p>subject</p></div>
                        <div><p>I</p></div>
                        <div><p>He/she/Other Singular Nouns</p></div>
                        <div><p>You/They/Other Plural Nouns</p></div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="beVerbTableBottom">
                        <div><p>Be Verb Form</p></div>
                        <div><p>am</p></div>
                        <div><p>is</p></div>
                        <div><p>are</p></div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p> So, if you look at the subject type, you can find the subject, “I.” When using “I” as the subject, the “be” verb becomes “am.” Note that “am” is used only with the subject “I.” All other subjects will use “is” or “are” depending on their countability, but I will explain that in another lesson. For now, let’s continue with our sentence. 
                </p>

                <p>Good! Now, I have a subject and a verb. Finally, the “be” verb can be used to describe a variety of things. Here are some examples: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Feelings</li>
                    <li>Professions</li>
                    <li>Names</li>
                    <li>Status</li> 
                    <li>Condition</li>
                    <li>Names of things and objects</li> 
                </ul>

                <p>Let’s start easy and use a feeling to finish this sentence. I’m going to use “happy” because it’s easy to understand and imagine. 
                </p>

                <p>Subject - Verb - Object <br>&emsp; I &emsp; &ensp; am &emsp; happy. </p>

                <p>Now, I have my first SVO sentence! This may not seem like a lot, but it’s a huge step into the world of English learning, especially for those who might be new to learning English. Now, I want you to practice making a few sentences in these next guided steps. 
                </p>

                <h2>Explanation 2</h2>

                <p>Here are five of the most common subjects used with the verb “is.” </p>

                    <p>1. <u>This</u> is him.</p>

                <p>“This” is a noun that is used to point at a person or a thing that is close to the speaker. You can use it for living and non-living things. </p>

                    <p>2. <u>That</u> is Mike.</u></p>

                <p>“That” is a noun that is used to point at a person or thing that is not near the speaker. Like “this,” you can use it for both living and non-living things. </p>

                    <p>3. <u>He</u> is greedy.</p>
                
                <p>“He” is a noun that is used to point at a male person. Typically, we use this with human beings, however, you may also use this with animals or creatures if you know that it is a male. </p>

                    <p>4. <u>She</u> is Jolly.</p>

                <p>“She” is a noun that is used to point at a female person. Like, “he,” it is typically used to point at human beings, but it can be used with animals or creatures as well. </p>

                    <p>5. This is a goat. <u>It</u> is ugly.</p>

                <p>“It” is a noun that is mostly used to point at objects and animals. However, we don’t usually introduce an object for the first time using “it.” Instead, we use “it” in the second or third sentence after it is introduced. “It” points at “goat” here. You will see “it” a lot throughout this course, but don’t stress over it’s use for now.  </p>

                <p>Finally, I want to introduce “you” and “they.” These two subjects use the “are” form of the be-verb, like this. </p>

                    <p>1. <u>You</u> are silly.</p>

                <p>“You” is an interesting subject. Typically, we use it to point at one person as it means “あなた.” However, in old English, “you” used to point at multiple people at the same time. We do still have some similar uses where “you” can point at multiple people, but that will be taught in another lesson. “You” is used to point at human beings. </p>

                    <p>2. <u>They</u> are quick.</p>

                <p>“They” is a subject that points at multiple things or objects. It can point at both living and non-living things.  </p>
