                <p>On the grammar explanation pages, you can read through explanations of various grammar points.
                    Here, on this page, you will see those explanations in action through reading prompts.
                    These prompts offer a way for you to learn vocabulary while exercising the grammar knowledge that you previously learned.
                    For those of you who may have a higher-level of vocabulary, or those who are interested in learning more difficult vocabulary, 
                    you can adjust the vocabulary level by selecting a level from the dropdown menu contained inside the reading prompt box. 
                </p>

                <p>This page has a lot to offer, such as the reading prompt, vocabulary, and even audio recordings. The page is layed out in the recommended
                    progression order; However, just doing things once and as they appear won't be too effective. Here is my recommended progression, which should give
                    you a lot more benefit than just blindly progression through each section.
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Complete vocabulary flashcards</li>
                    <li>Read the reading on the default setting (level 01)</li>
                    <li>Listen to the audio recording of the reading</li>
                    <li>Look up any additional words you don't know</li>
                    <li>Reread and relisten to the reading at least one more time</li>
                    <li>Progress to reading comprehension questions when you are ready</li>
                    <li>Adjust reading level and repeat process with increased difficulty</li>
